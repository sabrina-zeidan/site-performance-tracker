## Installation

This plugin can be installed as [a Composer dependency](https://packagist.org/packages/xwp/site-performance-tracker):

```
composer require xwp/site-performance-tracker
```

It relies on [PSR-4 autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#psr-4) as defined in the [`composer.json` file](composer.json).


## Usage

The following hooks can be added to a theme or a custom plugin. To confirm they were applied look for the "webVitalsAnalyticsData" in the page source. Collected data will be available in [Web Vitals Report](https://web-vitals-report.web.app/) in a few days.

### Limit the number of events sent

Using the following filter you can send the events for a limited percentage of your traffic, this limits the performance metrics to be sent only for 5% of the traffic:

```php
add_filter( 'site_performance_tracker_chance', function() {
	return 0.05;
} );
```

### Hooks

There are the following hooks available to further customize the way the plugin works:

##### Disable the plugin

Programmatically disable the plugin.

```php
apply_filters( 'site_performance_tracker_disabled', boolean $is_disabled = false );
```

##### Enable web vitals tracking

To send web vitals to Google Analytics in a format compatible with the [Web Vitals Report](https://web-vitals-report.web.app/), enable the following theme support and passing in the ID, both UA- and G- ID formats are supported:

Analytics is supported, requires passing the ID using `ga_id`:
```php
add_theme_support( 'site_performance_tracker_vitals', array(
	'ga_id' => 'UA-XXXXXXXX-Y',
) );
```
Gtag is supported, requires passing the Analytics ID (not GTM-) using `gtag_id`:
```php
add_theme_support( 'site_performance_tracker_vitals', array(
	'gtag_id' => 'UA-XXXXXXXX-Y',
) );
```

Analytics v4 is supported, requires passing the ID using `ga4_id`:
```php
add_theme_support( 'site_performance_tracker_vitals', array(
	'ga4_id' => 'G-XXXXXXXXXX',
) );
```

If you need to override the Google Analytics dimensions (defaults to dimensions1 through 3) to store these under, pass them along on the add theme support initialisation:
```php
add_theme_support( 'site_performance_tracker_vitals', array(
	'gtag_id'            => 'UA-XXXXXXXX-Y',
	'measurementVersion' => 'dimension7',
	'eventMeta'          => 'dimension8',
	'eventDebug'         => 'dimension9',
) );
```
